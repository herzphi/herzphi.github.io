Machines require regular maintenance to avoid breakdowns. When machines fail on a production line, downtime disrupts operations. To monitor a machine's health, sensor data can be analyzed. In this example, a machine with 14 sensors is examined. The first plot shows the sensors over time as sinusoidal functions with noise. The last two sensors show significant deviations later, indicating a potential issue requiring maintenance.

To determine whether a machine needs checking, we calculate the covariance matrix, which shows the variance relationships between the 14 features. The heatmap of the covariance matrix reveals that most of the variance is explained by two sensors, matching the earlier observations.

Next, we compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to identify the directions of greatest variance. The third plot projects the data onto the space defined by these eigenvectors, showing most points centered around (0,0) with some deviations.

To automatically distinguish normal from abnormal data, we apply the EllipticEnvelope algorithm. The fourth plot highlights normal data points in blue and outliers (potentially indicating a machine fault) in orange, clearly separating the machine's good and bad states.
